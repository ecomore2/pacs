IMAGES:
Insert them with: ![alt text](image.png)
You can also resize them if needed: convert image.png -resize 50% image.png
If you want to center the image, go through HTML code:
<div style="text-align:center"><img src ="image.png"/></div>

REFERENCES:
For references: Put all the bibTeX references in the file "references.bib"
in the current folder and cite the references as @key or [@key] in the text.
Uncomment the bibliography field in the above header and put a "References"
title wherever you want to display the reference list.

## Errors on the dates

Let's explore the time differences between the 4 dates:

```{r}
pacs %>% 
  filter(abs(onset - hospitalization) > 15 |
         abs(onset - consultation) > 15 |
         abs(onset - sample_collection) > 15 |
         abs(hospitalization - consultation) > 15 |
         abs(hospitalization - sample_collection) > 15 |
         abs(consultation    - sample_collection) > 15) %>% 
  select(id, onset, hospitalization, consultation, sample_collection)
```

```{r include = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
write.csv("dates_to_check.csv", quote = FALSE, row.names = FALSE)
```

*   1: error on the year
*   4: day and month were switched for onset and consultation
*   6: day and month were switcheid for hospitalization and consultation
*   7: day and month were switched for onset
*  28: day and month were switched for onset
*  33: day and month were switched for onset
*  71: year for consultation and sample_collection are not compatible
*  85: I suspect it should be be December 2012, but should be verified
* 159: probably no error
* 167: day and month were switched for consultation and sample_collection

## Positive cases without any date

```{r}
pacs %>% 
  filter(is.na(onset), is.na(hospitalization), is.na(consultation), is.na(sample_collection)) %>% 
  filter(pcr == "positive" | ns1 == "positive") %>% 
  select(id) %>% 
  unlist() %>%
  unname()
```
